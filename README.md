# DATA SET:


This dataset reflects the crime incidents recorded in the City of Los Angeles starting from the year 2020 to the present.
The dataset spans from 2020 to the present, offering a comprehensive look at crime trends over a significant period.
Data is transcribed from original crime reports that are initially documented on paper, which suggests a manual process of data entry into the digital database.
Since it is transcribed from original crime reports that are typed on paper and therefore there may be some inaccuracies within the data

1. Understanding the Data
This analysis explores crime data in a major city from 2020 to 2023, focusing on identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies within the reported incidents. The dataset includes various attributes such as dates of reporting and occurrence, crime types, victim demographics, and geographical details.

2. Data Cleaning
The dataset underwent thorough cleaning, including removing duplicate entries, correcting erroneous data points, and handling missing values. Specific columns with high percentages of missing data, such as 'Weapon Used Cd' and 'Cross Street', were excluded to maintain the integrity of the analysis.

3. Data Inspection
Statistical summaries revealed the distribution and central tendencies of numerical attributes, while categorical data were evaluated for frequency counts. The inspection phase highlighted the skewed nature of certain variables, such as 'Vict Age', and the dominance of specific crime types.

4. Data Visualization
a. Crime Trends Over Time
Line plots depicted an overall increase in crime rates, with notable fluctuations that did not correlate with expected pandemic-related decreases. Certain times of the year showed higher crime rates, suggesting seasonal patterns.

b. Distribution of Victim Ages
Histograms indicated that most reported victims fall within the 20-40 age range, highlighting the vulnerability of this demographic.

c. Crime Types and Delays in Reporting
Bar charts and heatmaps illustrated the prevalence of vehicle theft, assault, and identity theft as the most common crimes. There's an emerging trend in identity theft, underscoring its growing threat. Moreover, burglary and theft reports often experienced delays, suggesting a lapse between occurrence and detection.

d. Geographic and Demographic Vulnerabilities
Heatmaps and pie charts revealed that no area within the city is exempt from crime, with certain regions like Central and 77th Street being particularly affected. Both genders appeared equally at risk, with a slight variation in crime types affecting different racial and ethnic groups.

5. Exploratory Questions
Investigations into the dataset raised several questions regarding the effectiveness of current crime prevention strategies, the impact of socio-economic factors on crime rates, and the adequacy of support for victims.


# INSIGHTS FROM DATA

•	The crime rate has been on an uptrend, challenging the notion that the city is becoming safer.
•	Identity theft is identified as a rapidly growing concern, necessitating immediate and targeted countermeasures.
•	Delays in reporting for burglary and theft highlight the need for increased public awareness and possibly, enhanced surveillance or reporting mechanisms.
•	Despite a comprehensive spread of crime across the city, identified hotspots should be the focus of intensified policing and community support programs.
•	The 20-40 age demographic represents a significant proportion of victims, pointing to the need for tailored preventive measures.

Lets see how these insights and analytics are going to be important for authorities and the community.
